Django 1.7 throws django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Models aren't loaded yet

 Django looks for an environment variable called DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE, which should be set to the import path of your settings.py. For example, DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE might be set to 'mysite.settings', assuming mysite is on your Python path.When you run python manage.py shell, the command takes care of setting DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE for you. You will need to use python manage.py shell in these examples, or Django will throw an exception.
